# Hi, I'm Ganesh.

I'm a **Software Engineer** with **4+ years of experience** building scalable, production-grade systems, primarily in the **fintech** and **cloud-native** domains. I specialize in **Python**, **Java**, **React**, **SQL**, and **AWS**. I have a strong foundation in **full-stack development**, **workflow automation**, and **data engineering**, with a focus on **building systems that drive measurable business impact**.

### üöÄ About Me

- **End-to-End Expertise**: I can deploy an MVP in hours using **GenAI tools**, and have hands-on experience with **data ingestion pipelines** and **ETL processes**.
- **AI & Research**: Recently, I‚Äôve trained **vision transformers** like **SWIN**, **Segformer**, and **LaneATT** on **event-based camera data** for **high-accuracy road lane detection**‚Äîoutperforming traditional methods.
- **Robotics & Autonomous Systems**: Currently, I'm a **Research Assistant** at the **UTA Research Institute**, developing real-time perception and motion tracking systems for autonomous platforms using **sensor fusion** and **event-based vision**.
- **Passion**: I enjoy solving complex problems, optimizing code, and building prototypes that just work. I'm driven by a desire to create smarter, more efficient tools that have a meaningful impact.

### üöÄ Deployed Projects

Here are a couple of my deployed projects:

### [Everleaf - AI-based LaTeX editor](https://everleaf-app.vercel.app/)

Everleaf is an AI-native LaTeX editor built to simplify academic writing by automating formatting, citations, and content editing.It features real-time LaTeX compilation, PDF preview, and mobile-friendly editing. The frontend is built with React and Tailwind CSS, while the backend uses Node.js and Express. For AI capabilities, it integrates Meta‚Äôs Llama 3.1 via Groq API for fast, context-aware language generation. Uploaded documents are processed using LlamaParse, and their embeddings are stored in Pinecone for vector-based retrieval. A RAG pipeline powers the research assistant, enabling users to ask questions or insert references from their own uploaded papers. A key technical focus was enabling surgical editing of LaTeX‚Äîmodifying targeted sections without breaking document structure.
