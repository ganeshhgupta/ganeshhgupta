# Hi, I'm Ganesh.

I'm a **Software Engineer** with **4+ years of experience** building scalable, production-grade systems, primarily in the **fintech** and **cloud-native** domains. I specialize in **Python**, **Java**, **React**, **SQL**, and **AWS**. I have a strong foundation in **full-stack development**, **workflow automation**, and **data engineering**, with a focus on **building systems that drive measurable business impact**.

### üöÄ About Me

- **End-to-End Expertise**: I can deploy an MVP in hours using **GenAI tools**, and have hands-on experience with **data ingestion pipelines** and **ETL processes**.
- **AI & Research**: Recently, I‚Äôve trained **vision transformers** like **SWIN**, **Segformer**, and **LaneATT** on **event-based camera data** for **high-accuracy road lane detection**‚Äîoutperforming traditional methods.
- **Robotics & Autonomous Systems**: Currently, I'm a **Research Assistant** at the **UTA Research Institute**, developing real-time perception and motion tracking systems for autonomous platforms using **sensor fusion** and **event-based vision**.
- **Passion**: I enjoy solving complex problems, optimizing code, and building prototypes that just work. I'm driven by a desire to create smarter, more efficient tools that have a meaningful impact.
